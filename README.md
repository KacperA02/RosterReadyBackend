# RosterReady Backend

## Final Year Project

This is the backend for my **Final Year Project**. The application will handle CRUD functionality and provide additional features such as a **CSP solver**. It is built using **FastAPI** for the backend framework and **MySQL** to store the data. 

### Project Overview

**RosterReady** is an application that generates schedules for teams or organizations based on various factors like availability, shifts, and other constraints. The goal is to automate and streamline the scheduling process to meet specific needs of users and teams.

### About This Repository

- The backend is a work in progress.
- It is my first time using **FastAPI** and my first time working with **Python** in the backend.
- Expect frequent commits where files might be completely changed or even deleted as the project evolves.

### Development Process

"Let's see how it goes with using YouTube tutorials and the FastAPI docs to build a secure and solid backend."

### Features (Planned):

- **CRUD Functionality**: Basic Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for users, teams, and schedules.
- **CSP Solver**: Implementing a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) solver to create optimal schedules based on user-defined constraints

### Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
- **MySQL**: A relational database used to store application data.
- **SQLAlchemy**: An ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for interacting with the MySQL database.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the backend development.

### Future Improvements

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implementing secure login and user management features.
- **Unit Testing**: Add comprehensive tests to ensure reliability.
- **Error Handling**: Improve the error-handling mechanisms to provide better feedback to users.
